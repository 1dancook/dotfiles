# A simple script to use for wezterm to quickly edit the pasteboard in neovim
# With wezterm default behavior, SpawnCommandInNewTab will open a new tab with this, and it will close when done.

# First, paste into a temp file

pbpaste > /tmp/scratchpaste.txt

# open it for editing

nvim /tmp/scratchpaste.txt   # hint, do some edits, then ZZ

# then copy the contents back to the clipboard after nvim is closed
